# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

An **Education Technology / Analytics** project that predicts **student grades** and potential **dropout risk** using historical performance, attendance records, and demographic data.

---

## 📖 Description
This project applies **machine learning regression models** to student datasets to forecast academic performance and dropout risk.  
It helps educators identify at-risk students early and design effective interventions for academic success.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – data preprocessing and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – regression modeling and evaluation

---

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **[UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)**, which includes:
- Demographic attributes  
- Attendance records  
- Academic performance history  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts **final student grades**.  
- Identifies **dropout risk** based on academic and behavioral data.  
- Generates **visual reports** to better understand student performance trends.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
   cd student-performance-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 📊 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Student_Performance.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the notebook cells to:
   - Load and clean the dataset  
   - Train regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
   - Visualize predictions and performance metrics  

---

## 📈 Example Results
- 📉 Scatter plots comparing **predicted vs actual grades**  
- 📊 Feature importance analysis (which factors influence grades most)  
- 📋 Risk analysis for potential student dropouts
