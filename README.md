🎓 Student Performance Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

The Student Performance Prediction System is a Machine Learning project designed to predict:

📊 Student Final Grades

⚠️ Student Dropout Risk

The system uses historical academic records, attendance data, and demographic information to help identify students who may need academic support.

This project was developed during an AI internship aligned with industry practices used in organizations like Microsoft.

🎯 Objectives

Predict student academic performance using regression models

Identify potential dropout students using classification models

Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering

Build dashboard-style visual analytics

Evaluate model performance using standard ML metrics
